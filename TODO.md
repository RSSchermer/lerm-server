# TODO List

- Find cleaner way to implement CurrentUserResource as singleton (upstream?).
- Find cleaner way to authorize the creation of resources that belong to a 
  project, see rule, data element, rule conflict, rule relationship, membership,
  phrase and statement controllers (upstream?).
- Remove exception whitelisting workaround from base resource controller when
  jsonapi-resources 0.7.1 is released.
